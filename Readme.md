# Description

This repository contains soluition for the following problem.

For given Java function of special type (there are examples in exemples folder), find all possible values that can be printed.

There are 2 solutions here.

First use SAT solver (It is used to solve path constraints for each possible value)

Second do the same but without solver. Due to restriction for functions structure path constraints are just sets of values.
